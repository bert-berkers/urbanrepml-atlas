## A note on confirmation bias before we look at anything

The author of this report (Claude) has documented priors from project memory: *"Ring agg k=10 outperforms all learned UNet variants on leefbaarometer probes."* The user explicitly warned that visual evaluation is biased by priors — *"if I tell you to see something in a blank image you'll see it."*

The procedure used to mitigate this:
1. **Blind structural reading first.** Each panel was described in terms of visual structure (color blocks, speckle, sharp boundaries) before mapping to geography or interpreting meaning.
2. **Disconfirmation passes.** Several initial claims were retracted after looking at higher-resolution panels. Retractions are recorded inline ("Correction" headers).
3. **Quantitative anchors.** Cluster centroids in EPSG:28992 and PCA variance ratios (sidecar JSONs at [`panels/stats/`](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/stats/)) ground visual claims.
4. **Control panel.** Dutch gemeente 2024 boundaries (342 polygons, EPSG:28992) provide independent geographic reference, used before any embedding panel was read.

This is a single-author visual study. It would benefit from independent re-reading with embedding identities masked.

### The geographic control we read first

![Gemeente 2024 control panel — 342 Dutch municipalities at EPSG:28992](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/control/province_boundaries.png)

Before opening any embedding panel, the analyst studied the Netherlands' admin geography to fix a reference frame. The 342 gemeente polygons reveal where to expect what:

- **Wadden chain** at the top — Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland, Schiermonnikoog as a narrow string.
- **IJsselmeer** and **Markermeer** as the two large empty oval lakes north-center, with a clear closure dyke (Afsluitdijk) cutting them from the Wadden Sea.
- **Randstad** in the central-west — visible as a dense subdivision of small municipalities (Amsterdam, Utrecht, Den Haag, Rotterdam and their satellite cities).
- **Friesland and Drenthe** in the north — larger gemeente blocks, less subdivided, indicating lower population density.
- **Veluwe area** in the central-east — also large gemeente blocks (the protected forest is sparsely populated).
- **Brabant–Limburg arc** in the south — Eindhoven and Tilburg as visible urban centers within larger rural hinterlands.
- **Limburg peninsula** as the southern panhandle.
- **Zeeland** as the south-western archipelago.

This is the country we are about to see through three different statistical lenses.

## Headline finding (quantitative, before any pixel)

| Embedding | Dim | PC1 var | PC2 var | PC3 var | Top-3 sum | Largest cluster | Smallest cluster |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Concat (raw) | 208 | 18.7% | 9.4% | 7.2% | **35.3%** | 22.3% | 0.5% |
| Ring-Agg k=10 | 208 | 17.9% | 10.6% | 7.6% | **36.2%** | 21.5% | 2.7% |
| U-Net (learned) | 64 | **62.5%** | **30.7%** | 5.4% | **98.6%** | **26.8%** | 1.3% |

**The U-Net's 64D representation is effectively rank-3.** PC1+PC2 alone capture 93.2% of its variance. By contrast the 208D concat and ring_agg representations have variance distributed across many axes — PC1 barely accounts for one-fifth of either.

This is consequential before we look at a single pixel: the U-Net has *learned to compress.* Its three principal components are a faithful summary of essentially the whole representation. Concat and ring_agg's PCs show only ~36% of their underlying signal — large structure may be hiding in PC4–PC10+. Visual claims about PC-RGB and PC1-turbo panels must be read with this asymmetry in mind. **A bold-looking U-Net PC-RGB panel does not mean the U-Net "sees more" — it might mean it sees less, but more confidently.**

---

## Concat — the simplest representation

The concat embedding is the four input modalities (AlphaEarth 64D + hex2vec POI 50D + Roads 30D + GTFS 64D) stacked together with no further processing. No smoothing. No learned mixing. Each of the 397,757 hexagons stands alone with whatever its modalities say.

### What KMeans finds in concat

![Concat — KMeans k=10, tab10](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/concat/clusters_tab10.png)

**Initial reading at 3-way thumbnail size suggested "no coherent structure." This was wrong.**

At full resolution the structure resolves into something genuinely informative, even though the per-hex variance reads as noise at first glance:

- **Blue** dominates Friesland and Flevoland — northern agricultural polders.
- **Pink/magenta** holds Drenthe and parts of Overijssel — sandy, rural, low-density.
- **Yellow** picks up Zeeland's island mosaic and the Wadden chain — coastal/water-mixed environments.
- **Green** scatters through eastern rural Gelderland and Overijssel — agricultural but with a different signature than the northern blue.
- **Orange and red** concentrate in the Randstad band (Amsterdam → Utrecht → Den Haag → Rotterdam), AND in a southern cluster (Eindhoven → Tilburg → Den Bosch). Red is reserved for the most urbanized hex cores; orange surrounds them.
- **Pink** dominates the Limburg peninsula with red urban dots at Maastricht and Heerlen.
- The IJsselmeer's eastern shore reads as a clean blue line — the polder boundary is visible.

The structure is there. It just lives at hex resolution and the eye reads the per-hex variance as noise until the maps are large.

### What PCA finds in concat

![Concat — PC1 → turbo, PC1 captures 18.7% of variance](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/concat/pc1_turbo.png)

This is the cleanest reading in the entire study. **Concat PC1 lights up cities everywhere in the country**:

- The Randstad band glows red across its full extent.
- Eindhoven, Tilburg, Den Bosch in the south — red dots.
- Maastricht and Heerlen in Limburg — red dots.
- **Groningen in the far north** — a red dot.
- Enschede, Nijmegen, Arnhem, Apeldoorn, Zwolle in the east — red dots.
- All rural areas, regardless of region, are blue/cyan.

PC1 in raw concat is essentially an urbanization index. It is uniform across the country: a city in Friesland and a city in Limburg both light up. Despite explaining only 18.7% of total variance, this signal is strong, repeatable, and geographically meaningful.

![Concat — PCA(3) → rank-norm RGB](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/concat/pcrgb_rank.png)

The full 3-PC RGB is muted by comparison — predominantly yellow-green tinted with pink/magenta concentrated in central-west. Lower chromatic variation than the U-Net version, consistent with PCs accounting for only 35% of variance. The cyan dots throughout signal smaller urban concentrations; the orange/red Randstad-and-southern-arc signal is preserved here too.

---

## Ring Aggregation — what spatial smoothing changes

Ring Aggregation k=10 takes the concat embedding and replaces each hex's vector with a weighted average over its k=10 ring of neighbors. Zero parameters. Pure spatial smoothing. Per project memory, this representation **outperforms all learned U-Net variants** on the leefbaarometer probe — a result we should not let bias our visual reading.

### What KMeans finds in ring_agg

![Ring-Agg — KMeans k=10, tab10](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/ring_agg/clusters_tab10.png)

The same general regional pattern as concat, but now smoothed into much larger coherent blocks:

- **Brown** dominates the northern rural mainland — Friesland, Drenthe, north-eastern Overijssel.
- **Pink** central-north including the Wadden mainland and the band around the IJsselmeer.
- **Orange** forms a large blob over the Randstad with **red** concentrated in the urban cores (Amsterdam–Utrecht–Den Haag–Rotterdam) sitting *inside* the orange ring. This nesting of red-in-orange is visually striking — it reads as "city core within suburban metro" with a clear gradient.
- **Cyan/teal** appears as smaller scattered clusters, mostly along edges and in the central river area.
- **Green** dominates the east and south — Gelderland, Brabant, Limburg.
- **Yellow** holds Zeeland.
- The Wadden islands themselves are a pink chain.

Clusters group hexes by region, not by individual-hex feature alone. **That is the smoothing doing what the smoothing is for.** Every hex is now reading partly as itself and partly as its neighborhood — and the neighborhood signal dominates at the cluster boundary.

### What PCA finds in ring_agg

![Ring-Agg — PC1 → turbo, PC1 captures 17.9% of variance](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/ring_agg/pc1_turbo.png)

The same urbanization-everywhere signal as concat, but smoother. The Randstad band is broader and less crisp (averaging in suburbs), and individual eastern cities still light up but with halos rather than sharp dots. **The PC1 axis is essentially the same as concat's** — variance ratios 17.9% vs 18.7%, visually indistinguishable in pattern.

This is important: ring_agg's improvement on probes is *not* coming from a different latent axis. It's coming from spatial regularization at the hex level — each hex now shares evidence with its neighbors, making it a less noisy estimator of "what kind of place is this hex."

![Ring-Agg — PCA(3) → rank-norm RGB](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/ring_agg/pcrgb_rank.png)

Similar palette and dynamic range to concat's PC-RGB — pink/magenta in central-west, green/yellow in rural east, faint Wadden chain visible. The smoothing has cleaned up the per-hex noise but the macrostructure is unchanged.

---

## U-Net — what a learned model finds

The U-Net is the only learned encoder in this comparison. It takes the 208D concat as input, runs a multi-resolution encoder–decoder over the spatial graph, and outputs a 64D learned representation. It has hundreds of thousands of parameters. The leefbaarometer probe says it loses to ring_agg's zero-parameter smoothing.

### What KMeans finds in U-Net

![U-Net — KMeans k=10, tab10, dim=64](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/unet/clusters_tab10.png)

**Initial reading at 3-way thumbnail size suggested U-Net was "the most spatially coherent." This was wrong.**

At full resolution U-Net is **at least as speckly as concat at the hex level**. What it does have is **extremely sharp urban hot-spots** on a dominantly cyan rural background. Look at the central-west: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Den Haag, Utrecht appear as discrete, well-defined red/orange blobs with crisp boundaries. The red/orange spots scattered elsewhere are individual cities — Eindhoven, Tilburg, Nijmegen, Groningen, Zwolle, Maastricht.

**Cluster 0 alone holds 26.8% of all hexes** — the cyan rural background is one large class. The U-Net has compressed the country into "rural background" plus a handful of specialized urban classes. This is the most concentrated cluster distribution of the three embeddings.

### What PCA finds in U-Net — the surprise

![U-Net — PC1 → turbo, PC1 captures 62.5% of variance](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/unet/pc1_turbo.png)

**This is the most interesting panel in the study, and the easiest one to misread.**

Two patterns superimpose **additively**:

1. **A north–south latitudinal gradient.** Northern Friesland, Drenthe, and the Wadden chain are in dark blue/purple — the bottom of the PC1 scale. Brabant and Limburg in the south are in cyan/teal — the middle of the scale. The transition is visible as a faint band running roughly east–west across central NL.
2. **Urban hot-spots in red/orange** at every city in the country — Randstad cities glow brightest, but Eindhoven, Nijmegen, Arnhem, Tilburg, Maastricht, Zwolle, Leeuwarden, **and Groningen** all show as warm patches lifted above their regional background. The northern cities' patches are orange/yellow rather than red because the latitude term subtracts from their PC1 value, but they are *not* hidden.

**Correction (disconfirmation pass).** An earlier draft of this report claimed "the north–south gradient overrides urbanization" and "Groningen is barely visible." Both claims overstated the panel: Groningen reads as a clear orange patch on a cold purple background — it is dimmer than Eindhoven only because its latitude bias is more negative, not because urbanization has been suppressed. The right reading is **additive**: PC1(hex) ≈ a · urbanization(hex) + b · latitude(hex), where northern cities sit at high urbanization + low latitude bias and end up with intermediate PC1 values. Concat's PC1 is pure urbanization (no latitude term); U-Net's PC1 has folded a regional baseline into the same axis.

**Hypothesis (low-confidence)**: the GTFS modality has higher density in the south/Randstad than in the north — Northern Groningen has trains but the *region around it* doesn't have anything like the transit density of Brabant. If the U-Net weights GTFS heavily, PC1 will mix urbanization with regional transit density, which correlates with latitude. This is a guess. **Confirming requires reading the PC1 component vector against the 64 latent dimensions and inspecting which input modalities drive it.** Not done in this session.

![U-Net — PCA(3) → rank-norm RGB, top-3 PCs cover 98.6% of variance](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/unet/pcrgb_rank.png)

The most chromatically dramatic of the three — vivid pinks in central-west, greens in the east, blues in the north, purples in the south, with sharp boundaries between regions. The eye reads this as *rich information.* It is not. **It is variance concentration.** With PC1+PC2+PC3 = 98.6% of variance, the dynamic range maps almost everything to bold colors. Concat and ring_agg's PC-RGB show only 35–36% of variance and look correspondingly muted — but the muting reflects information *spread across more axes*, not less information.

---

## Comparing the three side by side

### Clusters

![3-way comparison — KMeans clusters, tab10](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/comparison/clusters_tab10_3way.png)

**Spatial coherence ranking (from this view alone):** U-Net > Ring-Agg > Concat.

**Spatial coherence ranking (after looking at full-resolution panels):** Ring-Agg > U-Net ≈ Concat at hex level. U-Net has the *sharpest urban/rural binary* but its rural background is itself speckly.

The 3-way thumbnail is misleading because downsampling cancels concat and U-Net's hex-level speckle (averaging it out into smoother colors) but does nothing for ring_agg (which has spatial structure that survives downsampling). Visual coherence in a thumbnail is an artefact of resolution, not a property of the embedding. **This was the analyst's most important disconfirmation pass in this study.**

### PC1 → turbo

![3-way comparison — PC1 turbo](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/comparison/pc1_turbo_3way.png)

The clearest comparison in the study. Concat and ring_agg PC1 are visually nearly identical — urbanization across the country, with ring_agg slightly smoother. U-Net PC1 is different in a specific way: it is urbanization **plus** a north-south latitude term, added. Northern cities still read as warm patches (Groningen, Leeuwarden are visible as orange spots), just at lower absolute PC1 values than equally-urbanized southern cities. **All three embeddings have a "PC1 = something about urbanization" axis**; the U-Net's PC1 additionally encodes a regional baseline that shifts the whole scale across latitude.

### PC-RGB

![3-way comparison — PCA(3) → rank-norm RGB](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/comparison/pcrgb_rank_3way.png)

The U-Net panel looks dramatic. The concat and ring_agg panels look muted. **This comparison is unfair to concat and ring_agg by construction**, because their top-3 PCs cover only 35–36% of variance whereas the U-Net's cover 98.6%. To make this comparison meaningful you would need to either (a) compare U-Net's 3-PC view against the top-3 components of concat/ring_agg expanded out to *equivalent variance coverage* (which would require ~10+ PCs each), or (b) compare them all on a fixed budget (e.g. first 3 components regardless of variance). Neither is done here. The visual takeaway "U-Net is more colorful" should not be read as "U-Net is more informative."

## What the embeddings agree on — Dutch macro-geography

Across all three embeddings and two encodings (clusters and PC1-turbo), the same large-scale features recur:

- **The Randstad band** (Amsterdam–Utrecht–Den Haag–Rotterdam) is the most salient single feature in every panel.
- **A south-east urban arc** through Eindhoven–Tilburg–Den Bosch is a secondary urban cluster in every panel.
- **Wadden islands** form a distinct northern chain in every panel.
- **Zeeland's** island geography reads as a separate class everywhere.
- **Limburg as a peninsula** has its own coloration in every panel.
- **The IJsselmeer's eastern shore** reads as a clean linear feature — the polder boundary is visible in concat clusters and in all three PC1-turbo views.

**This is reassuring**: the underlying signal is real, not an artefact of any one model's inductive biases. Three radically different statistical approaches (no model, zero-parameter smoothing, learned deep encoder) agree on what the major regions of the Netherlands are. They disagree on which axis to put first and how sharp to draw the boundaries.

---

## What the embeddings disagree on — and what it might mean

### 1. Hex-level coherence

- **Concat** treats every hex independently. Its KMeans assigns each hex to the cluster nearest its 208D feature vector with no spatial regularization. Adjacent hexes can land in different clusters if their POI counts or road densities differ.
- **Ring-Agg** explicitly averages each hex with its k=10 neighborhood. Adjacent hexes have nearly identical inputs, so they nearly always land in the same cluster. Coherence is the design goal.
- **U-Net** has no explicit spatial regularization at the output but has multi-resolution graph convolutions in the encoder. At hex level it ends up speckly like concat — but its *cluster centroids* in 64D are sharply separated, so the urban cores read as crisp.

**A single-cluster map would be maximally coherent and totally uninformative.** Visual coherence is not the same as quality. The probe results — which the visual analysis cannot replicate — are the actual quality signal. Per project memory, ring_agg wins on leefbaarometer probes.

### 2. PC1 axis

- **Concat PC1**: clean urbanization axis, uniform across the country. Groningen lights up as red on the same scale as Eindhoven.
- **Ring-Agg PC1**: same as concat PC1, slightly smoothed.
- **U-Net PC1**: urbanization PLUS a north-south latitude term, additively. Groningen is still a warm patch — orange rather than red — because the latitude term lowers its absolute PC1 value relative to equally-urbanized southern cities, not because urbanization has been removed from the axis.

The U-Net has folded a regional baseline into its first principal component alongside urbanization. Whether this is a useful inductive bias (e.g. "northern cities really are different from southern cities at the same population density, so the model is right to encode the regional baseline") or a defect (e.g. "the model is mixing two independent signals into one axis and losing discriminative power") cannot be answered visually. **This is an empirical question.** A probe targeting urbanization labels would give the answer.

### 3. Variance concentration

- **Concat & Ring-Agg**: top-3 PCs cover ~36% of variance. Information is distributed across many axes.
- **U-Net**: top-3 PCs cover 98.6%. Information is concentrated on essentially two axes (PC1+PC2 = 93.2%).

The U-Net has *learned to compress.* Whether its training objective rewarded compression that aligns with downstream tasks (good) or rewarded compression that destroyed task-relevant variation (bad) determines whether this is a feature or a defect. The probe result — ring_agg wins — is evidence the compression discarded something the probes need.

### 4. Cluster size distribution

- **Concat**: largest cluster 22.3%, smallest 0.5%. Most distributed.
- **Ring-Agg**: largest 21.5%, smallest 2.7%. Most balanced.
- **U-Net**: largest 26.8%, smallest 1.3%. Most concentrated on one dominant class.

U-Net's "rural background" cluster (cluster 0, 26.8% of all hexes) is the largest single class in the study. The U-Net has effectively decided that more than a quarter of the Netherlands is one kind of place. Whether this is correct depends on what "kind of place" means.

---

## Reading the Netherlands through three lenses

If we take all the panels together and try to read the country, six features emerge that are present in every embedding:

1. **The Randstad as a megaregion.** Every embedding picks it out as a distinct cluster or a clear PC1 hot-spot. The boundary between "Randstad" and "rest of Holland" is sharp in U-Net, gradient-like in concat. Possibly the strongest single feature in Dutch human geography.
2. **A south-east urban arc.** Eindhoven through Tilburg, Den Bosch, Nijmegen. A discontinuous belt that every embedding distinguishes from the surrounding rural Brabant–Gelderland.
3. **Wadden as a zone in itself.** The chain of islands reads as distinct from the mainland in every embedding. The drivers are probably AlphaEarth (sand/water signature) plus very low GTFS density.
4. **Zeeland as ocean-adjacent islands.** Distinct cluster signature, probably AlphaEarth-driven (water + agricultural mosaic).
5. **Limburg as a peninsular distinct.** Soil and elevation differ from the rest of NL — visible in cluster maps as a region with its own dominant class.
6. **A north–south asymmetry that U-Net adds to its PC1.** Concat and ring_agg show only modest north–south differentiation. U-Net has folded it into PC1 *additively* — northern cities are still recognizable as urban (Groningen reads as a clear warm patch), they are just at a lower absolute PC1 value than equally-urbanized southern cities. Whether the regional baseline U-Net is encoding reflects something real about northern vs southern Dutch urban form (different transit density, different soil, different housing stock) or is a model-imposed regional confound is the most interesting open question from this study.

These read like genuine geography, not embedding artefacts, because they recur across very different model families. What the *embeddings* differ on is which axis to put first (urbanization vs latitude × urbanization), and how sharp to draw the regional boundaries.

---

## Closing the loop — probe target overlay + cluster identities

The descriptive analysis above assigned cluster IDs to regions ("orange clusters concentrate in central-west") based on visual inspection alone. Two complementary additions make those claims testable: an overlay of the actual probe target the embeddings are scored against, and per-cluster centroid annotations on the map so the reader can verify which cluster ID lives where.

### The leefbaarometer target

![Leefbaarometer score, LBM-2022, viridis colormap, 33% coverage of res9 hexes](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/target/leefbaarometer.png)

This is what the three embeddings are ultimately probed against. **High score (yellow) = better leefbaarometer-defined liveability; low score (purple) = worse.** Score range nationally is 3.42–5.04 with mean 4.20 and std 0.12 — a tight distribution, so subtle viridis differences are large in standardised terms.

**Coverage caveat (significant).** The leefbaarometer parquet covers 130,467 of the 397,757 res9 hexes (33%). The missing 67% are rural / agricultural / water hexes outside built-up areas where the leefbaarometer is undefined. Visually this manifests as a sparse, lacy rendering — only urban and peri-urban areas show colour, the countryside is slate. **This means per-cluster LBM means in the next subsection have very different sample sizes per cluster** — rural-dominated clusters have tiny LBM-coverage (3–11%) and their reported means are noisy.

**Visible structure in the LBM panel** (read after the embedding panels, with all the priming caveats from the bias note up top):
- The Randstad reads as a yellow-green high-score band — Amsterdam, Utrecht, The Hague, Rotterdam show as the brighter pixels.
- Eindhoven, Tilburg, and the Brabant urban arc also yellow-green.
- The far north (Groningen, Friesland) reads as more muted teal-cyan even where built-up — including Groningen city itself.
- Limburg's southern peninsula (Maastricht, Heerlen) reads as mid-range teal — not as bright as the Randstad.
- The Veluwe forest area in the central-east is largely empty (no LBM data — those hexes are forest).

**Temporal alignment caveat.** The leefbaarometer parquet is the 2022 measurement, while the embeddings are labelled "20mix" — a temporal blend with AlphaEarth at 2022, POI/Roads at "latest" (2026 Overpass), and GTFS at 2026. The 2022 LBM aligns reasonably with AlphaEarth but lags the OSM-sourced modalities by ~4 years. **For a publication-ready alignment, the 20mix label should be revisited or a fully-2022 embedding constructed.**

### The annotated ring_agg cluster panel

![Ring-Agg k=10 clusters with centroid annotations and per-cluster legend](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/ring_agg/clusters_tab10_annotated.png)

The centroids are the mean (RD x, RD y) of each cluster's member hexes — they are **spatial centres of mass, not single-city locations**. A cluster whose hexes span the whole country can have its centroid land in an area that doesn't visually look like the cluster's most prominent region. Read centroid position together with the cluster's main visible blobs.

Mapping cluster IDs to dominant Dutch regions (size + visible distribution):

- **Cluster 2** (largest, 21.5%) — centroid (194594, 448275). Despite the centroid landing east-of-centre, this is the **green block dominating the eastern and southern provinces** — Gelderland, Brabant, parts of Limburg. The dominant rural-mixed signature.
- **Cluster 5** (17.4%) — centroid (166929, 486005). The **pink central-north band** spanning the IJsselmeer rim and into Drenthe.
- **Cluster 6** (14.6%) — centroid (177941, 526828). The **brown northern Friesland/Drenthe block** — the most rural mainland signature.
- **Cluster 3** (9.2%) — centroid (168078, 484834). Mid-sized cluster near the Veluwe.
- **Cluster 9** (8.9%) — centroid (153712, 455645). Includes a large LBM-covered fraction (96% coverage in this cluster) — likely **the Randstad fringe / suburban**.
- **Cluster 8** (7.8%) — centroid (117349, 436319). Western, including South Holland and Zeeland edges.
- **Cluster 7** (7.6%) — centroid (183357, 451133). The bright **orange/red dots scattered through the central NL** — almost certainly the urban-core class given the very high mean LBM (see table below).
- **Cluster 1** (5.8%) — centroid (158406, 471634). Mid-size, central west.
- **Cluster 4** (4.4%) — centroid (144626, 486763). The Wadden / IJsselmeer-edge yellow.
- **Cluster 0** (2.7%, smallest) — centroid (177119, 499404). Specialised cluster.

### What the LBM correlation reveals — and what it doesn't

**Three observations from the table:**

1. **The cluster-LBM signal is weaker than the visual story suggests.** All cluster means fall in the band 4.13–4.34. The national std is 0.12, so the strongest cluster is roughly +1 std above the national mean and the weakest is roughly -0.5 std below. KMeans on these embeddings does not produce a clean "high-LBM cluster" vs "low-LBM cluster" partition — it produces a moderately informative gradient where the highest-mean cluster covers ~10-25% of LBM-rated hexes at most.

2. **Top-LBM clusters tend to have low LBM coverage** — they are sparse urban-core specialists. Concat C2 (86th pct, only 11% LBM coverage), Ring-Agg C7 (90th pct, 6% coverage), U-Net C2 (80th pct, 3% coverage) all match the visual "small bright dots = urban cores" story. Their high means are real but based on a small fraction of each cluster's member hexes.

3. **The bottom-LBM cluster in every embedding is the densely-LBM-covered one.** Concat C9 (36th pct, 91% coverage), Ring-Agg C9 (28th pct, 96% coverage), U-Net C3 (29th pct, 97% coverage). **This is the working-hypothesis "suburban / lower-income urban fringe" cluster** — mostly built-up, well-covered by LBM, but scoring below the national mean. All three embeddings find this class, with similar size (~9-9% for concat, ~9% for ring_agg, ~9% for U-Net). Cross-embedding agreement here is the strongest single signal in the table.

**Disconfirmations of earlier visual claims:**

- The earlier claim that "**orange and red concentrate in the Randstad band, AND in a southern cluster (Eindhoven → Tilburg)**" (Concat section) holds at the cluster-level: Concat C2 is the high-LBM cluster (4.319 mean, 86th pct) and visually maps to Randstad + southern urban arc. **This is corroborated.**
- The claim that "**[U-Net] Cluster 0 alone holds 26.8% of all hexes — the cyan rural background is one large class**" matches the table: U-Net C0 (106,648 hexes, 35% LBM coverage, 56th pct mean) is the rural-background class with near-mean LBM. **Corroborated.**
- The earlier hypothesis that "**ring_agg's improvement on probes is *not* coming from a different latent axis**" is **partially disconfirmed** by this table. Ring-Agg's per-cluster spread is wider (4.139–4.343, range 0.20) than Concat's (4.133–4.319, range 0.19) and U-Net's (4.143–4.293, range 0.15). Ring-Agg's clustering does separate LBM more cleanly per cluster than U-Net's, despite all three using KMeans on PCA-reduced features. **This is consistent with ring_agg winning leefbaarometer probes** — the spatial smoothing produces clusters that align more cleanly with leefbaarometer-relevant geographic structure.
- The earlier claim that "**U-Net has bound urbanization to latitude in PC1**" — if true, we would expect U-Net's clusters to be less LBM-discriminating than concat's or ring_agg's. The table is consistent with this: U-Net's LBM range across clusters (0.15) is the narrowest of the three. **Weakly corroborated** — needs the actual probe R² numbers to confirm.

**Caveats that should temper any confident conclusion:**
- Per-cluster means with <10% LBM coverage (italicised in the tables) are based on hundreds to a few thousand hexes per cluster — they are noisy estimators of cluster identity even though the means themselves are precise.
- KMeans cluster IDs are arbitrary across embeddings (different random initialisations would produce different IDs even at the same seed) — cross-embedding cluster identity is not preserved.
- The 4-year temporal mismatch between the 2022 LBM and the 2026-Overpass POI/Roads modalities means we are correlating a 2022 outcome variable against partly-2026 input features. The direction of the bias is unclear but should be flagged for any quantitative use.

## What this study cannot tell you

- **Which embedding is "best."** Probes answer that. Visual analysis here is descriptive, not evaluative. Memory says ring_agg wins on leefbaarometer.
- **What U-Net's PC1 north–south component actually is.** Requires reading per-modality loadings. Not done here.
- **Whether the 26.8% U-Net dominant cluster is "rural background" or "everything-except-cities."** Requires correlation against population density / land-use classes per hex.
- **How temporal stability looks.** This is the 20mix year only. Re-running on 2022 vs 2024 would reveal whether the embeddings track change.
- **What probe targets fall inside each cluster.** Cross-tabulating cluster membership against leefbaarometer scores would close the descriptive-to-supervised loop.

## Open questions for follow-up

1. **U-Net PC1 decomposition.** Read the 64-dim latent → PC1 vector and rank by per-modality loading. Is GTFS responsible for the north–south gradient?
2. **Cluster–boundary correlation.** Compute per-cluster centroid vs gemeente boundaries (Jaccard or homogeneity). Does any of the three embeddings cluster the Randstad as a single municipality-set?
3. **Probe overlay.** ✓ DONE — see [Closing the loop](#closing-the-loop--probe-target-overlay--cluster-identities) section above. Leefbaarometer LBM-2022 panel rendered at the same Voronoi extent, plus per-embedding × per-cluster LBM correlation table at [`panels/stats/leefbaarometer_per_cluster.json`](../../data/study_areas/netherlands/stage3_analysis/2026-04-24/panels/stats/leefbaarometer_per_cluster.json). Key finding: ring_agg's per-cluster LBM spread is the widest of the three (range 0.20 vs 0.15 for U-Net), consistent with its known leefbaarometer probe advantage.
4. **Rasterize bug — promote to P0.** The Voronoi-based rasterization used for these panels is in `scripts/one_off/viz_three_embeddings_res9_study.py`. The same bug exists in `utils/visualization.py:rasterize_continuous` and is silently corrupting every published cluster/probe map across the project (13 callers). Replace with the Voronoi reference implementation and audit. *Already flagged in `.claude/scratchpad/coordinator/2026-04-24-keen-passing-moor.md` as `[open|0d]`.*
